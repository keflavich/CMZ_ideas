PP6 discussion about CMZ plans
------------------------------

Participating: Qizhou, Steve, Betsy, Cara, Diederich

Observing proposals:

 * Large-scale H2CO
  * Target front ring primarily
  * Emphasis on specific tests of dynamical models
  * Extremely sensitive continuum survey
   * CH3OH bonus; don't mention 

 * SMA 
  * Focus on ring again?
  * Chemical diversity (Betsy)
  * Ultra-high-density (10^7-10^8) gas

 * APEX H2CO
  * Temperature maps (like Immer 2012) covering whole zone
  * Zero-spacing for SMA observations
  
Need model plots for proposals:
 * Density (distribution) vs. position for some subset of plunging orbit models
 * Temperature vs position?
